# GalacticPiano

Play the piano and watch it make colorful art. You can use the keyboard with note names or your mouse to click on the piano keys.

This project was made during the Hack With the Beat Hack Club Event. 

I wanted to do something that incorporate music. Playing an online piano seemed liked an easy way to implement this. After being able to add the piano, I wanted to make it more unique, so I added the space theme with rockets and stars. I really struggled to implement the record button feature, I wasn't able to incorporate the sound into the recording, so I just kept the visual recording. Something I learned was that you can add code to the html file and it will show in the ouput.
